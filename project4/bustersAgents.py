    First computes the most likely position of each ghost that

    concerned):

      1) gameState.getLivingGhosts(), a list of booleans, one for each
         agent, indicating whether or not the agent is alive.  Note
         that pacman is always agent 0, so the ghosts are agents 1,
         onwards (just as before).

      2) self.ghostBeliefs, the list of belief distributions for each
         of the ghosts (including ghosts that are not alive).  The
         indices into this list should be 1 less than indices into the
         gameState.getLivingGhosts() list.
